# Chatbot Project

This project is a simple AI-powered chatbot built using Python, Keras, and Tkinter. The chatbot is designed to respond to user inputs based on predefined intents and patterns. It demonstrates natural language processing (NLP) techniques, machine learning model training, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction.

## Project Overview

This chatbot project uses a neural network model to classify user inputs into predefined intents and generate appropriate responses. The model is trained on a dataset of intents, and the chatbot can be interacted with through a simple Tkinter-based GUI.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Tokenization, lemmatization, and bag-of-words techniques are used to preprocess user inputs.
- **Machine Learning**: The chatbot uses a neural network model built with Keras to classify user inputs.
- **Graphical User Interface**: A Tkinter-based GUI allows for easy interaction with the chatbot.
- **Customizable Intents**: Easily modify the chatbot's behavior by updating the `intents.json` file.
